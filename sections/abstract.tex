Self-driving technology holds the promise to make travel safer and more efficient.
One of the most important steps to improving self-driving cars is to understand how humans behave using vehicles.
While some paths and trajectories are physically possible, some are socially unacceptable \cite{cui2019multimodal}.
People inherently respect social norms such as yielding right-of-way or respecting personal space. 
This paper builds on a method to enhance the prediction of vehicles using a neural network to introduce social forces between vehicles.
These social forces aim to mimick the social interaction between human-driven vehicles.
In particular, we focus on improving the discrete integration method used in the neural network, reducing the error between prediction and ground truth acceleration.
