\section{Problem Statement}
In our previous approach, we relied on a method known as ballistic integration. 
However, a significant challenge arises due to the inherent discretization error with working with discrete data.
Specifically, when we rearrange the integration formula to assess its fit with our data, 
we observe errors between the predicted acceleration and the ground truth.
These errors will furthermore be explored in the results section.

The differences in the accelerations affect the performance of the neural network, 
as the integration results are fed into the network.
