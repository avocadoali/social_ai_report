\section{Problem Statement}
In our current approach, we rely on a method known as ballistic integration for discrete integration in motion prediction. 
However, a significant challenge arises due to the inherent discretization error associated with working with discrete data.

Specifically, when we rearrange the integration formula to assess its fit with our data, we observe errors between the predicted acceleration and the ground truth.
These errors will furthermore be shown in the results section.
The differences in the accelerations affect the performance of the neural network, as the integration results are used as inputs to the network.
