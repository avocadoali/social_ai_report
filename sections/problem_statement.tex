\section{Problem Statement}
In our previous approach, we relied on a method known as ballistic integration. 
However, a significant challenge arises due to the inherent discretization error with working with discrete data.
Specifically, when we rearrange the integration formula to assess its fit with our data, 
we observe errors between the predicted acceleration and the ground truth.

The differences in the accelerations affect the performance of the neural network with which the previous team was working with, 
as the integration results are fed into the network.
