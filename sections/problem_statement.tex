\section{Problem Statement}

In our previous approach, we used a discrete integration method known as ballistic integration. 
A challenge arises due to the discretization error while working with discrete datasets.
Specifically, when we rearrange the integration formula to assess its fit with our data, we observe errors between the predicted acceleration and the ground truth.

The differences in the accelerations affect the performance of the neural network with which the previous team was working with, 
as the discrete integration results are fed into the network.
