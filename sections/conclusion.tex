\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We demonstrated that our linear model provided us with more equal results for both the distance model and 
the acceleration model.
This highlights the effectiveness of using a linear model as a discrete integration system.


 the equivalence of accelerations derived from both linear models was demonstrated, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in matching acceleration estimates
A comparison with the previously used ballistic integration method revealed significantly better performance in terms of MSE and MAE.

Finally, using the coefficients obtained from linear regression, we were able to predict both distance and velocity with high accuracy, although some error was observed. Visualizations of these predictions showcased their alignment with the ground truth, further validating the effectiveness of our integration model.
