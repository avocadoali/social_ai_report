\section{Results}

\subsection{Linear Model}

The linear models that predict the acceleration derived from the distance formula
(\ref{eq:lin_model_acc_dis}) and the model derived from the velocity formula (\ref{eq:lin_model_acc_vel}) solved using linear regression have the following test results:


\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Comparison Results: Distance Model and Velocity Model}
\label{tab:model_comparison}
\begin{tabular}{l S[table-format=1.4e-2] S[table-format=1.4e-2] S[table-format=1.4e-2]}
\toprule
 & {MSE} & {MAE} & {$R^2$ Score} \\
\midrule
Distance Model & 3.5392e-03 & 1.1892e-02 & 9.8918e-01 \\
Velocity Model & 3.5370e-03 & 1.1877e-02 & 9.8918e-01 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We can see that the predictions for the test set are quite accurate having small MSE and MAE. 
We can also plot our results into graphs to have a better visual understanding of our results

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\columnwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/figures/Prediction Acceleration (Linear Model, Distance).png}
        \caption{Test results Distance Model}
        \label{fig:minipage3}
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\columnwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/figures/Prediction Acceleration (Linear Model, Velocity).png}
        \caption{Test results Velocity Model}
        \label{fig:minipage4}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The graph seems to fit our low MSE and MAE values, as all predicted points are lying close to the red line which indicates
a perfect prediction.
Interestingly we can see that most inaccuracies lie in the middle where the acceleration is close to zero.
Our hypothesis is that if our acceleration is close to zero the model has the least amount of information for inference, leading
to a more scattered prediction in this region.

\subsection{Equivalence of accelerations}

Note that the both results from the linear regression look quite similar. 
This is due to the fact, that we specifically trained both models to fit the same dataset. 
The similarity can be seen in the following figure.
The left shows the how the predicted accelerations of both our linear models match up, while on the right we can see how the 
accelerations match up for the previously used ballistic integration method

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\columnwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/figures/Acceleration Equivalence (Linear Model).png}
        \caption{Caption for Figure 1}
        \label{fig:minipage3}
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\columnwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/figures/Acceleration Equivalence (Ballistic integration).png}
        \caption{Caption for Figure 2}
        \label{fig:minipage4}
    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Caption for the entire figure}
    \label{fig:combined_figure_2}
\end{figure}

In the following we can see the metrics of our results for the equivalence of the accelerations

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Model Performance Comparison}
\label{tab:model_comparison_lin_v_bal}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Model & MSE & MAE \\
\midrule
Linear Model & 1.8141e-06 & 7.5061e-04 \\
Ballistic Integration & 2.0698e+02 & 5.0158e-01 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We can clearly see that the accelerations from both our linear models match up better than the previously used
ballistic integration method.

\subsection{Predicion of the movement}
Using the coefficients determine by the linear regression we can rearrange the model such that the model predicts 
the distance (\ref{eq:distance_matrix}) and the velocity (\ref{eq:velocity_matrix}).
The following shows metrics for the prediciton of the distance and the velocity using the coefficients

\begin{table}[t]
    \centering
    \caption{Regression Metrics}
    \begin{tabular}{lccc}
    \toprule
 & {MSE} & {MAE} & {$R^2$ Score} \\
    \midrule
    Distance Formula & $1.3867 \times 10^{1}$ & $3.7239 \times 10^{0}$ & $9.8926 \times 10^{-1}$ \\
    Velocity Formula & $2.2635 \times 10^{0}$ & $1.5045 \times 10^{0}$ & $9.3378 \times 10^{-1}$ \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:regression_metrics}
\end{table}


As we can see all metrics are conditioned well. 
Though we can see that the MSE and MAE values the error is quite some bit zero.
This means that our prediction for the distance and velocity is not perfect. 
For a better understanding, we also visualized our findings

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\columnwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/figures/Prediction Distance using the coefficients.png}
        \caption{Caption for Figure 1}
        \label{fig:minipage3}
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\columnwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/figures/Prediction Velocity using the coefficients.png}
        \caption{Caption for Figure 2}
        \label{fig:minipage4}
    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Caption for the entire figure}
    \label{fig:combined_figure_2}
\end{figure}

Again, we can see that the prediction matches up with the ground truth very well. 
These results can then be visualized using the drone-dataset-tool provided with the dataset.
