# Social-ai
This [repository](https://github.com/avocadoali/social_ai_report) contains the source code of the report for the practical course: Motion Planning of Autonomous Vehicles - Scene-aware and Social-aware Motion Prediction for Autonomous Driving

Our topic was creating scene- and social-aware predictions for vehicles. As we are working with discrete datasets, previous teams were experimenting with different integration methods to describe the motion of a vehicle. However, they faced some problems with the inherent discretization error.
