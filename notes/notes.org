** Questions to be answered

Certainly! Here are some questions to help you elaborate on the problem statement in your report:
Challenges with the Current Approach:
    What specific limitations or challenges does the underlying neural network face in accurately predicting motion in dynamic environments?
    
    - currently using an integration method for discrete integration called ballistic integration
    - problem is that as we are working with discrete data, there happens to be discretization error
    - in our case after rearanging the formula to see if the integration model fits our data the acceleration does not fit the ground truth
    - this leads to bad results in the neural network, as our results of the integration are fed into the NN










Our method revolves around the use of a linear model to estimate the acceleration of vehicles.
By equating and rearranging the formula, we specifically ensure that the predicted accelerations maintain consistent. 
Whereas, using the old method of ballistic integration the discretization error heavily influence the accuracy.

The motivation behind choosing a linear model stems from its superior performance compared to alternative models tested during our experimentation. 
Through rigorous testing, we found that the selected linear model consistently outperformed others in terms accuracy in predicting the cars movement. 
Additionally, the simplicity and interpretability of the linear model make it an attractive choice for motion prediction tasks. 

To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we plan to compare the results obtained with our linear model against the old Ballistic Integration method, particularly focusing on the accuracy and consistency of the predicted accelerations. 
Additionally, we will evaluate the performance of our model using standard linear regression metrics such as R-value and MSE. 
Furthermore, we aim to extend our analysis by rearranging the model to predict velocity and distance, allowing us to assess its predictive capabilities.
In the end we will visualize our results using the existing drone-dataset-tool repo which was provided.




Description of the proposed method and the implementation
- introduce the dataset:
    - drone footage
    - different scenarios
    - X datapoints in total
    - show the columns

- we tested X different linear models
- most successfull one was this
- note: all columns are split into x- and y-components
- can split up our model for simplicity and code style

- the tests were run on over X datapoints and Y different datasets
- data was split into a training and a test set using the typical X:Y splitting method

- results: 
    - mse, r-score, and X for the evaluation 
    - show the accuracy of the acceleration prediction

    - problems:
        - Constant error might be due to rounding errors?
        - outlier data


Conclusions and future work
- results seem promising
- keep in mind this is only a linear model
- but might be sufficient for the neural network
- actually test it with the neural network
- test on other datasets







Can you provide a high-level overview of the methodology you propose?
- using a linear model we estimate the the acceleration of a car
- by equating and forming the equation in this way we assure that after rearranging the formula we will get similar results for the accelration

What motivated the choice of a linear model for acceleration estimation?
- we tested 8 other linear models and this one was the best
- motivation was similarity to the old ballistic integration (which are common formulas for discrete integration)

How do you plan to validate the effectiveness of your approach?
- we can evaluate the results by comparing it to the old appraoch (namely the old ballistic integration)
- we will also look at the common metrics of a linear regression such as r value, mse etc...
- then we can rearange the formulas to try to predict the velocity and distance from the cars
- here we can also look at common metrics for the prediction of a model such as mse and accuracy
- lastly we can visualize our results for a better representation



Methodology Overview:
You mentioned rearranging the formula to ensure similar results for acceleration. You could expand on this process to illustrate how it contributes to the effectiveness of your approach.
Rearanging the formula is a crucial step to ensure simlarity of the accelerations of both formulas

Motivation for Choosing a Linear Model:
Elaborate on why the linear model stood out among the other tested models. What specific characteristics or performance metrics made it the best choice?
The chosen linear model had the best results in all aspects such as mse, accuracy compared to the others

You mentioned the similarity to old ballistic integration formulas. You could further explain how this similarity benefits your approach and why it's relevant to the problem you're addressing.
it only adds one more parameter of the past acceleration
