Abstract 
- scene aware and social aware motion prediction
- some paths are physically possible but socially improbable
- introduction of forces between cars

Problem statement
- underying neural network has a discretization problem
- create a better discrete integration model
- model for the distances and velocity should compute matchung acceleration 

Concept overview
- using a linear model to estimate the acceleration
- will use linear regression to estimate the coefficients of the underlying model
- then rearrange the model such that it output the velocity and distance accurately again

Description of the proposed method and the implementation
- introduce the dataset:
    - drone footage
    - different scenarios
    - X datapoints in total
    - show the columns

- we tested X different linear models
- most successfull one was this
- note: all columns are split into x- and y-components
- can split up our model for simplicity and code style

- the tests were run on over X datapoints and Y different datasets
- data was split into a training and a test set using the typical X:Y splitting method

- results: 
    - mse, r-score, and X for the evaluation 
    - show the accuracy of the acceleration prediction

    - problems:
        - Constant error might be due to rounding errors?
        - outlier data


Conclusions and future work
- results seem promising
- keep in mind this is only a linear model
- but might be sufficient for the neural network
- actually test it with the neural network
- test on other datasets
